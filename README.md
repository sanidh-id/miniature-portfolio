# miniature-portfolio
This is a portfolio website created to learn more about the basics of web development like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, responsiveness & accessibility. Used Media Query for responsiveness & not Bootstrap. The colour palette & design of the website needs work but the basic functionality is working.

I was able to refresh my knowledge about HTML, CSS & JS during creating this website. I was also able to learn new information about the inportance of responsiveness & other accessibility features.
